Generic Django Libraries
========================

The ``openedx_django_lib`` folder gives us a place to define Django helper classes and functions
which are useful in ``openedx-core`` and may also be useful for external packages.
 
We may eventually merge these into the ``edx-django-utils`` repository, or merge that repository into
this package. For now, though, while we work on Open edX Core v1.0, it is useful to have ``openedx_django_lib``
co-located with the Core apps that we are developing.
