Tagging App
===========

The ``openedx_tagging`` app will enable content authors to tag pieces of content and quickly
filter for ease of re-use.

Motivation
----------

Tagging content is central to enable content re-use, facilitate the implementation
of flexible content structures different from the current implementation and
allow adaptive learning in the Open edX platform.

This service has been implemented as pluggable django app. Since it is necessary for
it to work independently of the content to which it links to.
